#### Introduction

Literarium is a Java Swing-based desktop application designed to simulate a digital bookstore. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface and supports two roles: Admin and Customer. The Admin role enables book inventory and customer inventory management, while the Customer role allows users to browse books, add them to their bill, and generate it.
